\subsection{Justification of the chosen language}
We have chosen to use the language C\# for this project. Because we wanted to make a graphical DSL, we needed a language that is suitable for making graphical applications. Above that, we needed to work with a database. The C\# language is well suited for this. Only one of us knew the language well, so a good knowledge of the chosen language wasn't a reason for choosing this language.
