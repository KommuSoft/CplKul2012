\subsection{User interface}
\subsubsection{Overview}
The userinterface describes the way how the user will communicate with the
system, and thus by extend contains the domain specific language. In our case
we've implemented a graphical language. Furthermore we've implemented a fully
modifiable two-stage compiler.
\subsubsection{Motivation for the graphical language}
Since most users who will use the systems are end-users and thus not
programmers or technical people, some problems might occur with textual
languages. Most end-users nowadays don't use any command line tools anymore and
have no proper understanding of technical textual languages. By implementing a
graphical language, we aim to solve the following problems:
\begin{itemize}
 \itemit{A more semantical granularity} a problem with textual languages is
the granularity, namely the character. Characters don't map to concepts
directly. With graphical languages, we can foresee a primitive for each concept
in the language. Therefore people have a better understanding of their queries.
Furthermore one can easier debug aspects (since their are less issues with
writing an incorrect character sequence).
 \itemit{Giving hints to the user} A graphical language allows us to insert
hints on how queries should be built. By adapting the primitives that only
certain combinations will match, users won't lose time trying these
combinations.
\itemit{Interactive support}Most graphical languages require a tool that somehow
tends to understand the language. These tools can offer interactive support
with the end user in order to build correct queries. This is of course possible
in a textual domain specific language. However these languages don't ``need''
a tool to built them.
\itemit{Limiting Expressiveness}Graphical languages are in general less
expressive than their textual counterparts. Since we implement a domain
specific language, we can see this as an advantage in order to prevent the
users from making mistakes.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Motivation for the Compiler}
We've implemented a two-stage compiler where the first stage maintains an
''abstract syntax tree'' consistent with the graphical expression at that
moment. The second stage implements a tiling algorithm looking for specific
patterns and translating them into what we call the intermediate representation.
\paragraph{}
Since we know all the use-cases in advance, we could simply implement
algorithms in the nodes of the abstract syntax tree to deal with translating
the expressions to their algorithmic counterparts. Since the database
\subsubsection{Lexer}
Most programming languages and by extend domain specific languages are parsed
in a structure called abstract syntax trees. The source code first pases
through a lexer who groups strings of characters together into tokens. Since we
implemented a graphical language, the graphical ``source code'' is already
tokenized: we simply group information into predefined graphical primitives who
can be considered the equivalent of a token.
\subsubsection{Parser}
When the source code is tokenized, a compiler component called the parser
injects some structure in the token stream by converting the stream into a
tree-structure. The parser knows how to do this since the order of the tokens
contains some cues on how the data is structured.
\subsubsection{Graphical language paradigms}
Graphical languages mainly use two paradigms: graph-based and tree-based. In a
graph based language, the user uses two basic concepts: nodes and edges. A
popular example is UML: the class diagram uses classes and the relations
between classes are represented as edges. The other paradigm is tree based. A
tree based approach is in a sense logical since the second step in a compiler:
the parser also transforms the language into a tree-based equivalent. Since
textual languages are eventually parsed in a tree structure, we can eliminate
some checks that a parser in a textual language should do: for instance
checking if the brackets in the language are matching. Since these constraints
are already forced at language level, it makes concepts easier for both the
programmer in the domain specific language and the developer of the language
itself.
\subsubsection{Beyond the parser}

\paragraph{Abstract syntax tree}
By working with a graphical language, we can however go beyond the parser. A
first step after the parser is building an abstract syntax tree out of a
concrete syntax tree: in a concrete syntax tree, the tokens are only
represented in the leaves of the tree. When the tree is converted into an
abstract syntax tree, tokens are moved to higher parts in the hierarchy. For
instance in the concrete syntax tree, the tokens \verb+5+, \verb+-+ and
\verb+3+ will all be leaves of the same node. In the abstract syntax tree, the
operator sign \verb+-+ will be the parent of the two integer leaves \verb+5+
and \verb+3+. This step can also be enforced at language level: simply by
making sure that the nodes in the tree contain data (independent from the fact
that they are leaves or not).

\paragraph{Symbol tables}
After the syntactical analysis, a semantical analysis is performed on a
language. In this step, symbol tables are prepared. A symbol table contains the
name of a variable, method,... together with information about that variable
like it's type. Since in most programming languages variables and methods have
a certain scope, different symbol tables are created for the different scopes.
As a result nodes in the abstract syntax tree are transformed into pointers
pointing to an entry in the symbol table. Based on the symbol tables,
semantical analysis can perform type checks. For instance the programming
language might force that we can only perform an addition on two integers. We
can modify our graphical language in such a way that it contains hints which
types are accepted and thus boost performance\footnote{If the language hints
or forces certain aspects, users won't lose time by trying these aspects.}.
Furthermore by slightly modifying the tree paradigm, the graphical language can
specify implicit symbol tables. If we allow link-nodes into our language, the
graphical language is based on a Directed Acyclic Graph.The user doesn't has to
specify the same values a second time, but can simply introduce a link piece
who points to a piece where the data is already specified.

\subsubsection{Proposed graphical language}
We've implemented a graphical language following the tree paradigm. The
graphical language is mainly based on a puzzle. In a puzzle, pieces must fit
into the gaps other pieces provide. Since each puzzle piece fills one gap and
provides zero or more gaps, a tree structure emerges.
%TODO: er moet nog een sub bij
\paragraph{Polymorphism and overloading}
How can the graphical language hint (or even force) the use of a certain piece
to fill a certain gap? In the physical world the gaps follow a certain pattern.
Only pieces who are compatible with this pattern, can fit into the the gap.
\subparagraph{}
The problem however with this approach is that the number of potential pieces
is in most cases limited to one. Sometimes however, it is possible that their
are different solutions to fill a gap. Most programming languages solve this
problem with polymorphism. We will need a mechanism to allow polymorphism.
Another aspect some puzzles use is graphical coherence: the resulting puzzles
must form a picture, not a colorful ensemble of dots.
\subparagraph{}
We adapted this concept to introduce polymorphism in our graphical language.
Each gap is surrounded by a sequence of colors. Each piece is filled with a
sequence of colors. If a puzzle piece has at least one color in common with the
colors surrounding the gap, the user of the language is allowed to use this
piece\footnote{It is of course possible that there are still constraints who
can't be expressed by a type system. The ``compiler'' of the domain specific
language will have to check on these additional constraints.}.
\subparagraph{}
Since the pieces only have to share one color, one can look to this relation as
a many-to-many relation: each gap allows several types of pieces. On the the
other hand a piece can fit into gaps with different type constraints. Therefore
this aspect is stronger than polymorphism: also overloading is supported since
the types of the ``parameters'' of a puzzle piece are somehow dynamic.
\subparagraph{}
A constraint on the use of colors is that the number a person can distinct is
limited. Research points out that humans with normal color perception
(trichromatic) can distinct around 36 colors. Since domain specific languages
however in general and more specific this language is limited in the amount of
polymorphism and overloading we assume this system will be sufficient.
