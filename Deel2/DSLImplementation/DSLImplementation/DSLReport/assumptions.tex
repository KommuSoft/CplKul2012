\section{Assumptions}
We've made the following assumptions through the development:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Each plane belongs to only one airline company.
 \item Each flight is organized by only one airline company. No two companies
can provide seats at the same plane for the same flight.
 \item An airport belongs to one city, no airport is located on the border
between two cities.
 \item Each city belongs to one country, there is no city in the world where a
part is located in one country and another part in another country.
 \item 36 types will be sufficient in the user interface system. This is also
the maximal amount of colors the human brain and eye can distinct.
\end{itemize}
