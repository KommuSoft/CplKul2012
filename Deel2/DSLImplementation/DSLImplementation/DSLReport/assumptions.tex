\section{Assumptions}
We've made the following assumptions through the development:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Each flight is organized by only one airline company. No two companies
can provide seats at the same plane for the same flight.
 \item An airport belongs to one city, no airport is located on the border
between two cities.
 \item Each city belongs to one country, there is no city in the world where a
part is located in one country and another part in another country.
 \item 17 types will be sufficient in the user interface system. This is half
the amount of colors the human brain and eye can distinguish.
\item The code of an airport is unique.
\item The duration of a flight is less than 24 hours.
\item The name of person is unique.
\item Each airplane has a unique code.
\item A seat in a flight can only be booked once.
\item Every class has an unique name.
\end{itemize}
