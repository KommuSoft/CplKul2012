\section{Guide to use}
With the latest version of MonoDevelop (version 3.0), it is possible to open the project by opening the \texttt{DSLImplementation.sln} file. That file can be found in the top directory DSLImplementation. In that way, it is possible to build the project in MonoDevelop. It is then possible to run the DSL. Also, a file is generated, namely \texttt{DSLImplementation.exe}. That file can be found in the directory DSLImplementation/bin/Debug/. By executing \texttt{mono DSLImplementation.exe} in a command line, the DSL can alternatively be run in that way.
