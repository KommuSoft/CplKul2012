\subsection{Adapter}
The adapter layer operates as an intermediate between the userinterface and the database. When there is a request for the database, for example adding something to the database, then the userinterface doesn't need to communicate directly with the database and so it doesn't need to know anything about the database. The adapter classes pass the requests from the user interface to the database and return results of queries on the database to the user interface.
