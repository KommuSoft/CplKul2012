\section{Example DSL programs}
In this section, we show some DSL example programs. %We have also put the example program files in the folder TODO:folder, because some example programs may be a bit unreadble in this document.

	\label{ex:DSLlayout}
\end{figure}
\noindent In the editor shown in figure \ref{ex:DSLlayout}, we can create our programs. This can be done by selecting the appropriate puzzle piece and then selecting the right block in the striped area. In that way, a chain of blocks is obtained. An example of such a chain of blocks is given in the next figure. In fact, it are three chains of blocks, but it now permits to give another illustration of the linking feature.

Now, we will work out an example in detail.

\subsection{Adding a country to the database}
As seen in figure 3, the color of the \texttt{run}block matches two puzzle pieces, namely \texttt{query} and \texttt{add}.
In this example, we want to add something, so we select the \texttt{add} puzzle piece and click on the \texttt{run}block Then, we can select the country puzzle piece and click on the \texttt{add}block. Adding another element instead of this, is just selecting another puzzle piece. The result of adding a country is seen below.

	\label{ex:addCountryInitial}
\end{figure}
\noindent We can also give the country a name by using the \texttt{Edit information} button on top. When this button is selected and you click on a block in the chain, the properties can be changed. The final result is given in the next figure.

	\label{ex:addCountry}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Adding a flight to the database}
As said before, we can add several sorts of elements to the database. A bigger example is adding a flight to the database. The program is shown below.

	\label{ex:addFlight}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Fetching the cities in a country}
It is possible to do more than only adding elements to the database. Namely, it is possible to get things from the database. For example, finding all the cities in a given country 'Belgium' can be done by the following DSL program.
