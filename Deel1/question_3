In almost every language there is something that is easy but difficult to write in another. In what can Lua distinguish itself from the other languages.
	Lua is very easy to write scripts (define script as a small program) and it has a very good C api. This makes Lua an excellent extension language (see games).
	
	C++ is an excellent language to write high performance programs. It's also a language that makes it very easy to use libraries. The designer of the library will have some difficulties but the user of the library can very easy interact with the library.
	
	Python is a very good language to write multi-platform programs because it has the "batteries included" principle. For example: Sick Beard, CouchPotato, Headphones, Subliminal these applications also run on a NAS.
	
	Haskell [Jonas: mss tof om te vermelden dat Haskell pseudocode is voor C++ TMP, dus in die zin is Haskell heel eenvoudig om functioneel te programmeren terwijl dit in C++ een (heel) stukje moeilijker (lees: syntax is veel langer) is] (https://github.com/boostcon/2011_presentations ctrl-f op pseudo en http://bartoszmilewski.com/2011/07/25/boostcon-haskell-c-videos/)
